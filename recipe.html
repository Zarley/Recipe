			<h1 id="title">Salmon Fried Rice</h1>
			

			<p>The best thing about making too much rice is that you have leftovers for fried rice, you know, the kind with some egg swirled in, chopped vegetables and a soy sauce based sauce. If you also happen to have some leftover cooked salmon (I know, its a stretch, but you might, right?) this salmon fried rice is one of the best possible things you could make with it.

			<p>We grilled up some fresh salmon the other day and had just enough leftover to toss into this fried rice dish. With the egg, peas, onions, ginger, garlic, and bell pepper, its a meal in itself! All brought together with lightly sweetened soy sauce.</p>

			<p>Now usually you would want to use day old rice for fried rice. Why? Because its drier, meaning it will fry better and get browned on the edges. We didnt have any, so instead I made a fresh batch of rice, spread it out on a sheet pan and put it in a 200F oven for 10 minutes, and then let it sit around, while I prepped other things.</p>

			<p>If you don't have day old rice, you can take freshly made rice, spread it out in an even layer on a sheet pan, and put it into a 200∞F (93∞C) oven for 12 minutes.</p>
